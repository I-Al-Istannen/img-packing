You have lots of images, a printer and a budget? You need to somehow put
everything into a single pdf for printing, but do not want all that wasted
space? `img-packing` will layout images densely in a multi-page pdf to reduce
wasted space, even rotating images by 90Â° if that makes them fit better.
Recognizing that rotating random images might mess up the griddy look of your
pdf, you can disable this with the `--no-rotate` switch.

## Installation
Download a binary from the
[releases](https://github.com/I-Al-Istannen/img-packing/releases) page or build
